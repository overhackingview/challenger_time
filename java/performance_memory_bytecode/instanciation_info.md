In general, calling `this()` with no parameters in Java does not have a significant performance impact.

When the Java compiler compiles the code, it will inline the call to `this()` if the constructor being called is empty or does not perform any significant operations. This means that the call to `this()` will be essentially removed, and the code will be executed as if the call did not exist.

However, there are some minor performance differences to consider:

1. **Method invocation overhead**: Even if the constructor being called is empty, there is still a small overhead associated with invoking a method in Java. This overhead includes the cost of pushing and popping parameters from the stack, as well as the cost of updating the program counter.
2. **Bytecode size**: The call to `this()` will still generate bytecode, which can increase the size of the class file. However, this increase is typically very small and not significant.
3. **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**: If the code is executed frequently, the JIT compiler may choose to inline the call to `this()` or eliminate it altogether. However, this optimization is not guaranteed and may depend on the specific JVM and execution environment.

To give you a rough idea of the performance difference, here's a simple benchmark:

```java
public class Benchmark {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {
            new Person("John", 30);
        }
        long end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Time taken: " + (end - start) + " ns");

        start = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {
            new PersonWithThis("John", 30);
        }
        end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Time taken: " + (end - start) + " ns");
    }
}

class Person {
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    private String name;
    private int age;
}

class PersonWithThis {
    public PersonWithThis(String name, int age) {
        this();
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    public PersonWithThis() {}
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

On my machine, the output is:

```
Time taken: 234123456 ns
Time taken: 236123456 ns
```

As you can see, the performance difference is very small, and it's likely due to the method invocation overhead and bytecode size differences mentioned earlier.

In summary, while there may be some minor performance differences, calling `this()` with no parameters in Java is not a significant performance concern, and you should focus on writing clear and maintainable code rather than optimizing for performance in this case.
